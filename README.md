As the capstone project for my Advanced Google Data Analytics Specialization on Coursera, I conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of New York City taxi trip data. The goal was to determine if there is a relationship between the payment type used by customers (credit card vs. cash) and the total fare amount.
Following the structured PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework emphasized throughout the Specialization, I went through the following key steps:

Imported and prepared the large taxi trip dataset, demonstrating my ability to work with real-world, messy data.
Performed extensive exploratory data analysis using descriptive statistics to gain a deep understanding of the data.
Formulated clear null and alternative hypotheses to test for differences in average fare between payment types.
Executed a rigorous two-sample t-test to evaluate the hypotheses, drawing on my proficiency in statistical concepts.
Communicated the key business insights from the analysis, as well as the limitations, in a clear and actionable manner for stakeholders.
